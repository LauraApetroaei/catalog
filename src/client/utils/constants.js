        '<strong>Rhythm</strong> refers to the amount of rhythmic content in a piece. Ambient and fully a-rhythmic pieces would be zero. Extremely rhythm-focused pieces would be at the highest numbers.',
    speed:
        '<strong>Speed</strong> is speed. Not just based on BPM but the presence (or lack) of urgency and forward movement. With lots of ambient and downtempo, the PatternBased catalog as a whole is slower than most.',

        'The lower numbers would correspond to the commercial usefulness or sonically straightforwardness of a piece. The highest numbers are generally more unusual from both a sonic/mix and musical standpoint.',
    mood:
        '<strong>Mood</strong> refers to the emotional content. Around zero you would find terror and extreme uncomfort. Lots of more complex emotional content like nostalgia and bittersweet around 3-6. While 7 and above would be uplifting and happy.',

        'Lower numbers would correspond to rigid mechanical pieces, straightforward electronic beat-based music. Higher numbers would correspond to looser, more organic human feeling live music.',
